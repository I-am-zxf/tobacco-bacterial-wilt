The two kinds of data we collected are stored in the ' RGB ' and ' hyperspectral imagery' folders, respectively.

In the hyperspectral file, all data are named according to the preprocessing method + acquisition date.
such as “dA-6.1.csv”
Where -dA is the pretreatment method, -6.1 is the collection date.

The codes of various comparison methods are named by their respective uses

The first and second collection times overlapped, and were generally classified as first batch and second batch. 

Part of the data used in the follow-up experiment is not public for the time being. Reproduction data can contact me and explain the use. My email is 843040386@qq.com
